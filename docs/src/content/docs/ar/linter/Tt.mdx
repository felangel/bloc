​📝 Description: Arabic Translation & Documentation Refinement
​This PR introduces a comprehensive Arabic translation for the Bloc documentation, covering the Introduction, Linter rules, and Tutorials. The goal is to make the documentation more accessible to the Arabic-speaking developer community while maintaining technical accuracy.
​🛠️ Key Changes:
​Bilingual Technical Terms: Applied a bilingual approach within the .mdx files by placing English technical terms in parentheses next to their Arabic counterparts (e.g., "State Management - إدارة الحالة"). This ensures clarity and consistency with the codebase.
​AI-Assisted Proofreading: Leveraged AI tools to audit the translation for grammatical accuracy, technical flow, and professional tone.
​Complete Coverage:
​Introduction: Core concepts, architecture, and naming conventions.
​Linter: Detailed explanations for new lint rules and configurations.
​Tutorials: Fully translated guides for Flutter Counter, Login, Firebase, and more.
​MDX Optimization: Maintained all Markdown structures, code blocks, and internal links to ensure seamless integration with the existing documentation site.
​🧪 Quality Check:
​[x] All English terms are preserved alongside Arabic translations.
​[x] Code snippets remain untouched and functional.
​[x] Formatting follows the standard .mdx guidelines of the project.
