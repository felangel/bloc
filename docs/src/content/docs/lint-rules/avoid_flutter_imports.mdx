Avoid introducing dependencies on Flutter within business logic components
(`Bloc` or `Cubit` instances).

## Rationale

Layering an application is a key part of building a maintainable codebase and
helps developers iterate quickly and with confidence. Each layer should have a
single responsibility and be able to function and be tested in isolation. This
allows us to keep changes contained to specific layers and minimize the impact
on the entire application.

As a result, business logic components should generally manage
feature/application state and contain business logic that is decoupled from the
UI layer. Events should flow into business logic components from the UI layer and
state should flow out of the business logic layer into the UI layer.

In addition, keeping business logic components decoupled from Flutter provides
the ability to reuse business logic across multiple platforms/frameworks (e.g.
Flutter, AngularDart, Jaspr, etc.).

## Examples

**DO NOT** import Flutter within your business logic components.

**BAD**:

<Code
	code={`
  import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';
  import 'packages:flutter/material.dart';

class CounterCubit extends Cubit<int> {
CounterCubit() : super(0);
}
`}
lang="dart"
title="counter_cubit.dart"
transformers={[transformerMetaHighlight()]}
class='warning'
meta="{2}"

/>

**GOOD**:

<Code
	code={`
  import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';

class CounterCubit extends Cubit<int> {
CounterCubit() : super(0);
}
`}
lang="dart"
title="counter_cubit.dart"

/>

## Enable

To enable the `avoid_flutter_imports` rule, add it to your `analysis_options.yaml` under `bloc` > `rules`:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="YAML List">
		<Code
			code={`
  bloc:
    rules:
      - avoid_flutter_imports
`}
			lang="yaml"
			title="analysis_options.yaml"
		/>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="YAML Map">
		<Code
			code={`
  bloc:
    rules:
      avoid_flutter_imports: true
`}
			lang="yaml"
			title="analysis_options.yaml"
		/>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>
