By default, the bloc linter will not report any diagnostics unless you have
explicitly configured your project's analysis options.

To get started, create or modify the existing `analysis_options.yaml` at the root of your
project to include a list of rules under the top-level bloc key:

<Code
	code={`
  bloc:
    rules:
      - avoid_flutter_imports
`}
	lang="yaml"
	title="analysis_options.yaml"
/>

Run the linter, using the following command in your terminal:

```sh
bloc lint .
```

The above command will analyze all files in the current directory and its
subdirectories but you can also lint specific files and directories by passing
them as command-line arguments:

```sh
bloc lint src/ test/
```

The above command will analyze all code in the `src` and `test` directories.

With the `avoid_flutter_imports` rule enabled, if any bloc or cubit file
contains a flutter import, it'll be reported as a warning:

<Code
	code={`
  import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';
  import 'packages:flutter/material.dart';

class CounterCubit extends Cubit<int> {
CounterCubit() : super(0);
}
`}
lang="dart"
title="counter_cubit.dart"
transformers={[transformerMetaHighlight()]}
class='warning'
meta="{2}"

/>

You can see the warning by running the `bloc lint` command:

```sh
bloc lint counter_cubit.dart
```

The output should look like:

```sh
warning[avoid_flutter_imports]: Avoid importing Flutter within bloc instances.
 --> counter_cubit.dart:2
  |
  | import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  = hint: Blocs should be decoupled from Flutter.
