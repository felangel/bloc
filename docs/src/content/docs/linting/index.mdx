Linting is the process of statically analyzing your code for potential bugs in
addition to programmatic and stylistic errors.

Bloc has a built-in linter, which can be used through your IDE or via the [`bloc
command-line tools`](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc_tools) using the `bloc lint`
command.

With the help of the bloc linter, you can improve the quality of your codebase
and enforce consistency all without having to execute a single line of code.

For example, perhaps you accidentally imported a Flutter dependency into your cubit:

<Code
	code={`
  import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';
  import 'packages:flutter/material.dart';

class CounterCubit extends Cubit<int> {
CounterCubit() : super(0);
}
`}
lang="dart"
title="counter_cubit.dart"
transformers={[transformerMetaHighlight()]}
class='warning'
meta="{2}"

/>

If properly configured, the bloc linter will point to the import and produce the following warning:

```sh
warning[avoid_flutter_imports]: Avoid importing Flutter within bloc instances.
 --> counter_cubit.dart:2
  |
  | import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  = hint: Blocs should be decoupled from Flutter.

In the following sections, we'll cover how to install, configure, and customize
the bloc linter in order take advantage of static analysis in your codebase.
