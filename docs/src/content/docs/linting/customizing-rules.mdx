You can customize the behavior of the bloc linter by changing the severity of
individual rules, individually enabling or disabling rules, and by exluding
files from static analysis.

## Enabling and Disabling Rules

The bloc linter supports a growing list of lint rules. Lint rules
don't all have to agree with each other. For example, some developers might
prefer to use blocs (`prefer_bloc`) while others might prefer to use cubits
(`prefer_cubit`).

:::note
Linter rules might contain false positives unlike static analysis. Feel free to
report any false positives or other issues by [filing an
issue](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/issues/new/choose).
:::

### Enabling Recommended Rules

The bloc library provides a set of recommended linter rules as part of the
[`bloc_lint`](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc_lint) package.

To enable the recommended set of lints add the `bloc_lint` package as a dev dependency:

```sh
dart pub add --dev bloc_lint
```

Then, edit your `analysis_options.yaml` to include the rule set:

<Code
	code={`
  include: package:bloc_lint/recommended.yaml
`}
	lang="yaml"
	title="analysis_options.yaml"
/>

:::note

When a new version of `bloc_lint` is published, code that previously passed
static analysis might start failing. We recommend updating your code to work
with the new rules but you can also optionally enable or disable individual
rules.

:::

### Enabling Individual Rules

To enable individual rules, add `bloc:` to the `analysis_options.yaml` file as a
top-level key, followed by `rules:` as a second-level key. On subsequent lines,
specify the rules you want as a YAML list (prefixed with dashes).

For example:

<Code
	code={`
  bloc:
    rules:
      - avoid_flutter_imports
      - avoid_public_bloc_methods
`}
	lang="yaml"
	title="analysis_options.yaml"
/>

### Disabling Individual Rules

If you include an existing rule set such as the `recommended` set, you may want
to disable one or more included lint rules. Disabling rules is similar to
enabling them, but requires the use of a YAML map rather than a list.

For example, the following includes the recommended set of lint rules except for
`avoid_public_bloc_methods` and additionally enables the `prefer_bloc` rule:

<Code
	code={`
  include: package:bloc_lint/recommended.yaml
  bloc:
    rules:
      avoid_public_bloc_methods: false
      prefer_bloc: true
`}
	lang="yaml"
	title="analysis_options.yaml"
/>

## Changing Severity

You can adjust the severity of any rule like so:

<Code
	code={`
  bloc:
    rules:
      avoid_flutter_imports: info
`}
	lang="yaml"
	title="analysis_options.yaml"
/>

Now the same lint rule will be reported with a severity of `info` instead of `warning`:

<Code
	code={`
  import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';
  import 'packages:flutter/material.dart';

class CounterCubit extends Cubit<int> {
CounterCubit() : super(0);
}
`}
lang="dart"
title="counter_cubit.dart"
transformers={[transformerMetaHighlight()]}
class='info'
meta="{2}"/>

The output of the `bloc lint` command should look like:

```sh
info[avoid_flutter_imports]: Avoid importing Flutter within bloc instances.
 --> login_cubit.dart:2
  |
  | import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  = hint: Blocs should be decoupled from Flutter.
 docs: https://bloclibrary.dev/lint-rules/avoid_flutter_imports

The supported severity options are:

| Severity  | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `error`   | Indicates the pattern is not allowed.              |
| `warning` | Indicates the pattern is suspicious but allowed.   |
| `info`    | Provides information to users but is not a problem |
| `hint`    | Proposes a better way of achieving a result.       |

## Excluding Files

Sometimes it's okay for static analysis to fail. For example, you might want to
ignore warnings or errors reported in generated code that wasn't written by you
and your team. Just like with official Dart lint rules, you can use the
`exclude:` analyzer option to exclude files from static analysis.

You can either list individual files or use [`glob`](https://pub.dev/packages/glob) patterns.

:::note
All usage of glob patterns should be relative to the directory containing the
corresponding `analysis_options.yaml` file.
:::

For example, we can exclude all generated Dart code via the following analysis options:

<Code
	code={`
  include: package:bloc_lint/recommended.yaml
  analyzer:
    exclude:
      - "**.g.dart"
`}
	lang="yaml"
	title="analysis_options.yaml"
/>
