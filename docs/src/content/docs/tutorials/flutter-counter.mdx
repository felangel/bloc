In the following tutorial, we're going to build a Counter in Flutter using the Bloc library.

![demo](~/assets/tutorials/flutter-counter.gif)

## Key Topics

- Observe state changes with [BlocObserver](/bloc-concepts#blocobserver).
- [BlocProvider](/flutter-bloc-concepts#blocprovider), Flutter widget which provides a bloc to its children.
- [BlocBuilder](/flutter-bloc-concepts#blocbuilder), Flutter widget that handles building the widget in response to new states.
- Using Cubit instead of Bloc. [What's the difference?](/bloc-concepts#cubit-vs-bloc)
- Adding events with [context.read](/flutter-bloc-concepts#contextread).

## Setup

We'll start off by creating a brand new Flutter project

<FlutterCreateSnippet />

We can then go ahead and replace the contents of `pubspec.yaml` with

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_counter/pubspec.yaml"
	title="pubspec.yaml"
/>

and then install all of our dependencies

<FlutterPackagesGetSnippet />

## Project Structure

```
├── lib
│   ├── app.dart
│   ├── counter
│   │   ├── counter.dart
│   │   ├── cubit
│   │   │   └── counter_cubit.dart
│   │   └── view
│   │       ├── counter_page.dart
│   │       ├── counter_view.dart
│   │       └── view.dart
│   ├── counter_observer.dart
│   └── main.dart
├── pubspec.lock
├── pubspec.yaml
```

The application uses a feature-driven directory structure. This project structure enables us to scale the project by having self-contained features. In this example we will only have a single feature (the counter itself) but in more complex applications we can have hundreds of different features.

## BlocObserver

The first thing we're going to take a look at is how to create a `BlocObserver` which will help us observe all state changes in the application.

Let's create `lib/counter_observer.dart`:

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_counter/lib/counter_observer.dart"
	title="lib/counter_observer.dart"
/>

In this case, we're only overriding `onChange` to see all state changes that occur.

:::note
`onChange` works the same way for both `Bloc` and `Cubit` instances.
:::

## main.dart

Next, let's replace the contents of `lib/main.dart` with:

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_counter/lib/main.dart"
	title="lib/main.dart"
/>

We're initializing the `CounterObserver` we just created and calling `runApp` with the `CounterApp` widget which we'll look at next.

## Counter App

Let's create `lib/app.dart`:

`CounterApp` will be a `MaterialApp` and is specifying the `home` as `CounterPage`.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_counter/lib/app.dart"
	title="lib/app.dart"
/>

:::note
We are extending `MaterialApp` because `CounterApp` _is_ a `MaterialApp`. In most cases, we're going to be creating `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` instances and composing widgets in `build` but in this case there are no widgets to compose so it's simpler to just extend `MaterialApp`.
:::

Let's take a look at `CounterPage` next!

## Counter Page

Let's create `lib/counter/view/counter_page.dart`:

The `CounterPage` widget is responsible for creating a `CounterCubit` (which we will look at next) and providing it to the `CounterView`.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_counter/lib/counter/view/counter_page.dart"
	title="lib/counter/view/counter_page.dart"
/>

:::note
It's important to separate or decouple the creation of a `Cubit` from the consumption of a `Cubit` in order to have code that is much more testable and reusable.
:::

## Counter Cubit

Let's create `lib/counter/cubit/counter_cubit.dart`:

The `CounterCubit` class will expose two methods:

- `increment`: adds 1 to the current state
- `decrement`: subtracts 1 from the current state

The type of state the `CounterCubit` is managing is just an `int` and the initial state is `0`.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_counter/lib/counter/cubit/counter_cubit.dart"
	title="lib/counter/cubit/counter_cubit.dart"
/>

:::tip
Use the [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FelixAngelov.bloc) or [IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12129-bloc) to create new cubits automatically.
:::

Next, let's take a look at the `CounterView` which will be responsible for consuming the state and interacting with the `CounterCubit`.

## Counter View

Let's create `lib/counter/view/counter_view.dart`:

The `CounterView` is responsible for rendering the current count and rendering two FloatingActionButtons to increment/decrement the counter.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_counter/lib/counter/view/counter_view.dart"
	title="lib/counter/view/counter_view.dart"
/>

A `BlocBuilder` is used to wrap the `Text` widget in order to update the text any time the `CounterCubit` state changes. In addition, `context.read<CounterCubit>()` is used to look-up the closest `CounterCubit` instance.

:::note
Only the `Text` widget is wrapped in a `BlocBuilder` because that is the only widget that needs to be rebuilt in response to state changes in the `CounterCubit`. Avoid unnecessarily wrapping widgets that don't need to be rebuilt when a state changes.
:::

## Barrel

Create `lib/counter/view/view.dart`:

Add `view.dart` to export all public facing parts of counter view.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_counter/lib/counter/view/view.dart"
	title="lib/counter/view/view.dart"
/>

Let's create `lib/counter/counter.dart`:

Add `counter.dart` to export all the public facing parts of the counter feature.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_counter/lib/counter/counter.dart"
	title="lib/counter/counter.dart"
/>

That's it! We've separated the presentation layer from the business logic layer. The `CounterView` has no idea what happens when a user presses a button; it just notifies the `CounterCubit`. Furthermore, the `CounterCubit` has no idea what is happening with the state (counter value); it's simply emitting new states in response to the methods being called.

We can run our app with `flutter run` and can view it on our device or simulator/emulator.
