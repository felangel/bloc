In the following tutorial, we're going to build a Firebase Login Flow in Flutter using the Bloc library.

![demo](~/assets/tutorials/flutter-firebase-login.gif)

## Key Topics

- [BlocProvider](/flutter-bloc-concepts#blocprovider), a Flutter widget which provides a bloc to its children.
- Using Cubit instead of Bloc. [What's the difference?](/bloc-concepts#cubit-vs-bloc)
- Adding events with [context.read](/flutter-bloc-concepts#contextread).
- Prevent unnecessary rebuilds with [Equatable](/faqs#when-to-use-equatable).
- [RepositoryProvider](/flutter-bloc-concepts#repositoryprovider), a Flutter widget which provides a repository to its children.
- [BlocListener](/flutter-bloc-concepts#bloclistener), a Flutter widget which invokes the listener code in response to state changes in the bloc.
- Adding events with [context.read](/flutter-bloc-concepts#contextselect).

## Setup

We'll start off by creating a brand new Flutter project.

<FlutterCreateSnippet />

Just like in the [login tutorial](/tutorials/flutter-login), we're going to create internal packages to better layer our application architecture and maintain clear boundaries and to maximize both reusability as well as improve testability.

In this case, the [firebase_auth](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth) and [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) packages are going to be our data layer so we're only going to be creating an `AuthenticationRepository` to compose data from the two API clients.

## Authentication Repository

The `AuthenticationRepository` will be responsible for abstracting the internal implementation details of how we authenticate and fetch user information. In this case, it will be integrating with Firebase but we can always change the internal implementation later on and our application will be unaffected.

### Setup

We'll start by creating `packages/authentication_repository` and a `pubspec.yaml` at the root of the project.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/packages/authentication_repository/pubspec.yaml"
	title="packages/authentication_repository/pubspec.yaml"
/>

Next, we can install the dependencies by running:

<FlutterPubGetSnippet />

in the `authentication_repository` directory.

Just like most packages, the `authentication_repository` will define it's API surface via `packages/authentication_repository/lib/authentication_repository.dart`

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/packages/authentication_repository/lib/authentication_repository.dart"
	title="packages/authentication_repository/lib/authentication_repository.dart"
/>

:::note
The `authentication_repository` package will be exposing an `AuthenticationRepository` as well as models.
:::

Next, let's take a look at the models.

### User

The `User` model will describe a user in the context of the authentication domain. For the purposes of this example, a user will consist of an `email`, `id`, `name`, and `photo`.

:::note
It's completely up to you to define what a user needs to look like in the context of your domain.
:::

[user.dart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/packages/authentication_repository/lib/src/models/user.dart ':include')

:::note
The `User` class is extending [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) in order to override equality comparisons so that we can compare different instances of `User` by value.
:::

:::tip
It's useful to define a `static` empty `User` so that we don't have to handle `null` Users and can always work with a concrete `User` object.
:::

### Repository

The `AuthenticationRepository` is responsible for abstracting the underlying implementation of how a user is authenticated, as well as how a user is fetched.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/packages/authentication_repository/lib/src/authentication_repository.dart"
	title="packages/authentication_repository/lib/src/authentication_repository.dart"
/>

The `AuthenticationRepository` exposes a `Stream<User>` which we can subscribe to in order to be notified of when a `User` changes. In addition, it exposes methods to `signUp`, `logInWithGoogle`, `logInWithEmailAndPassword`, and `logOut`.

:::note
The `AuthenticationRepository` is also responsible for handling low-level errors that can occur in the data layer and exposes a clean, simple set of errors that align with the domain.
:::

That's it for the `AuthenticationRepository`. Next, let's take a look at how to integrate it into the Flutter project we created.

## Firebase Setup

We need to follow the [firebase_auth usage instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth#usage) in order to hook up our application to Firebase and enable [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in).

:::caution
Remember to update the `google-services.json` on Android and the `GoogleService-Info.plist` & `Info.plist` on iOS, otherwise the application will crash.
:::

## Project Dependencies

We can replace the generated `pubspec.yaml` at the root of the project with the following:

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/pubspec.yaml"
	title="pubspec.yaml"
/>

Notice that we are specifying an assets directory for all of our applications local assets. Create an `assets` directory in the root of your project and add the [bloc logo](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/blob/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/assets/bloc_logo_small.png) asset (which we'll use later).

Then install all of the dependencies:

<FlutterPubGetSnippet />

:::note
We are depending on the `authentication_repository` package via path which will allow us to iterate quickly while still maintaining a clear separation.
:::

## main.dart

The `main.dart` file can be replaced with the following:

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/main.dart"
	title="lib/main.dart"
/>

It's simply setting up some global configuration for the application and calling `runApp` with an instance of `App`.

:::note
We're injecting a single instance of `AuthenticationRepository` into the `App` and it is an explicit constructor dependency.
:::

## App

Just like in the [login tutorial](/tutorials/flutter-login), our `app.dart` will provide an instance of the `AuthenticationRepository` to the application via `RepositoryProvider` and also creates and provides an instance of `AuthenticationBloc`. Then `AppView` consumes the `AuthenticationBloc` and handles updating the current route based on the `AuthenticationState`.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/app/view/app.dart"
	title="lib/app/view/app.dart"
/>

## App Bloc

The `AppBloc` is responsible for managing the global state of the application. It has a dependency on the `AuthenticationRepository` and subscribes to the `user` Stream in order to emit new states in response to changes in the current user.

### State

The `AppState` consists of an `AppStatus` and a `User`. The default constructor accepts an optional `User` and redirects to the private constructor with the appropriate authentication status.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/app/bloc/app_state.dart"
	title="lib/app/bloc/app_state.dart"
/>

### Event

The `AppEvent` has two subclasses:

- `AppUserSubscriptionRequested` which notifies the bloc to subscribe to the user stream.
- `AppLogoutPressed` which notifies the bloc of a user logout action.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/app/bloc/app_event.dart"
	title="lib/app/bloc/app_event.dart"
/>

### Bloc

In the constructor body, `AppEvent` subclasses are mapped to their corresponding event handlers.

In the `_onUserSubscriptionRequested` event handler, the `AppBloc` uses `emit.onEach` to subscribe to the user stream of the `AuthenticationRepository` and emit a state in response to each `User`.

`emit.onEach` creates a stream subscription internally and takes care of canceling it when either `AppBloc` or the user stream is closed.

If the user stream emits an error, `addError` forwards the error and stack trace to any `BlocObserver` listening.

:::caution
If `onError` is omitted, any errors on the user stream are considered unhandled, and will be thrown by `onEach`. As a result, the subscription to the user stream will be canceled.
:::

:::tip
A [`BlocObserver`](/bloc-concepts/#blocobserver-1) is great for logging Bloc events, errors, and state changes especially in the context analytics and crash reporting.
:::

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/app/bloc/app_bloc.dart"
	title="lib/app/bloc/app_bloc.dart"
/>

## Models

An `Email` and `Password` input model are useful for encapsulating the validation logic and will be used in both the `LoginForm` and `SignUpForm` (later in the tutorial).

Both input models are made using the [formz](https://pub.dev/packages/formz) package and allow us to work with a validated object rather than a primitive type like a `String`.

### Email

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/packages/form_inputs/lib/src/email.dart"
	title="packages/form_inputs/lib/src/email.dart"
/>

### Password

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/packages/form_inputs/lib/src/password.dart"
	title="packages/form_inputs/lib/src/password.dart"
/>

## Login Page

The `LoginPage` is responsible for creating and providing an instance of `LoginCubit` to the `LoginForm`.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/login/view/login_page.dart"
	title="lib/login/view/login_page.dart"
/>

:::tip
It's very important to keep the creation of blocs/cubits separate from where they are consumed. This will allow you to easily inject mock instances and test your view in isolation.
:::

## Login Cubit

The `LoginCubit` is responsible for managing the `LoginState` of the form. It exposes APIs to `logInWithCredentials`, `logInWithGoogle`, as well as gets notified when the email/password are updated.

### State

The `LoginState` consists of an `Email`, `Password`, and `FormzStatus`. The `Email` and `Password` models extend `FormzInput` from the [formz](https://pub.dev/packages/formz) package.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/login/cubit/login_state.dart"
	title="lib/login/cubit/login_state.dart"
/>

### Cubit

The `LoginCubit` has a dependency on the `AuthenticationRepository` in order to sign the user in either via credentials or via google sign in.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/login/cubit/login_cubit.dart"
	title="lib/login/cubit/login_cubit.dart"
/>

:::note
We used a `Cubit` instead of a `Bloc` here because the `LoginState` is fairly simple and localized. Even without events, we can still have a fairly good sense of what happened just by looking at the changes from one state to another and our code is a lot simpler and more concise.
:::

## Login Form

The `LoginForm` is responsible for rendering the form in response to the `LoginState` and invokes methods on the `LoginCubit` in response to user interactions.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/login/view/login_form.dart"
	title="lib/login/view/login_form.dart"
/>

The `LoginForm` also renders a "Create Account" button which navigates to the `SignUpPage` where a user can create a brand new account.

## Sign Up Page

The `SignUp` structure mirrors the `Login` structure and consists of a `SignUpPage`, `SignUpView`, and `SignUpCubit`.

The `SignUpPage` is just responsible for creating and providing an instance of the `SignUpCubit` to the `SignUpForm` (exactly like in `LoginPage`).

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/sign_up/view/sign_up_page.dart"
	title="lib/sign_up/view/sign_up_page.dart"
/>

:::note
Just as in the `LoginCubit`, the `SignUpCubit` has a dependency on the `AuthenticationRepository` in order to create new user accounts.
:::

## Sign Up Cubit

The `SignUpCubit` manages the state of the `SignUpForm` and communicates with the `AuthenticationRepository` in order to create new user accounts.

### State

The `SignUpState` reuses the same `Email` and `Password` form input models because the validation logic is the same.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/sign_up/cubit/sign_up_state.dart"
	title="lib/sign_up/cubit/sign_up_state.dart"
/>

### Cubit

The `SignUpCubit` is extremely similar to the `LoginCubit` with the main exception being it exposes an API to submit the form as opposed to login.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/sign_up/cubit/sign_up_cubit.dart"
	title="lib/sign_up/cubit/sign_up_cubit.dart"
/>

## Sign Up Form

The `SignUpForm` is responsible for rendering the form in response to the `SignUpState` and invokes methods on the `SignUpCubit` in response to user interactions.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/sign_up/view/sign_up_form.dart"
	title="lib/sign_up/view/sign_up_form.dart"
/>

## Home Page

After a user either successfully logs in or signs up, the `user` stream will be updated which will trigger a state change in the `AuthenticationBloc` and will result in the `AppView` pushing the `HomePage` route onto the navigation stack.

From the `HomePage`, the user can view their profile information and log out by tapping the exit icon in the `AppBar`.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/flutter_firebase_login/lib/home/view/home_page.dart"
	title="lib/home/view/home_page.dart"
/>

:::note
A `widgets` directory was created alongside the `view` directory within the `home` feature for reusable components that are specific to that particular feature. In this case a simple `Avatar` widget is exported and used within the `HomePage`.
:::

:::note
When the logout `IconButton` is tapped, an `AuthenticationLogoutRequested` event is added to the `AuthenticationBloc` which signs the user out and navigates them back to the `LoginPage`.
:::

At this point we have a pretty solid login implementation using Firebase and we have decoupled our presentation layer from the business logic layer by using the Bloc Library.
