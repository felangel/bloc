In the following tutorial, we're going to build a Counter in AngularDart using the Bloc library.

![demo](~/assets/tutorials/ngdart-counter.gif)

## Setup

We'll start off by creating a brand new AngularDart project with [stagehand](https://github.com/dart-lang/stagehand).

If you don't have stagehand installed, activate it via:

<ActivateStagehandSnippet />

Then generate a new project via:

<StagehandSnippet />

We can then go ahead and replace the contents of `pubspec.yaml` with:

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/angular_counter/pubspec.yaml"
	title="pubspec.yaml"
/>

and then install all of our dependencies

<InstallDependenciesSnippet />

Our counter app is just going to have two buttons to increment/decrement the counter value and an element to display the current value. Let's get started designing the `CounterEvents`.

## Counter Bloc

Since our counter's state can be represented by an integer we don't need to create a custom class and we can co-locate the events and bloc.

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/angular_counter/lib/src/counter_page/counter_bloc.dart"
	title="lib/src/counter_page/counter_bloc.dart"
/>

:::note
Just from the class declaration we can tell that our `CounterBloc` will be taking `CounterEvents` as input and outputting integers.
:::

## Counter App

Now that we have our `CounterBloc` fully implemented, we can get started creating our AngularDart App Component.

Our `app.component.dart` should look like:

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/angular_counter/lib/app_component.dart"
	title="lib/app_component.dart"
/>

and our `app.component.html` should look like:

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/angular_counter/lib/app_component.html"
	title="lib/app_component.html"
/>

## Counter Page

Finally, all that's left is to build our Counter Page Component.

Our `counter_page_component.dart` should look like:

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/angular_counter/lib/src/counter_page/counter_page_component.dart"
	title="lib/src/counter_page/counter_page_component.dart"
/>

:::note
We are able to access the `CounterBloc` instance using AngularDart's dependency injection system. Because we have registered it as a `Provider`, AngularDart can properly resolve `CounterBloc`.
:::

:::note
We are closing the `CounterBloc` in `ngOnDestroy`.
:::

:::note
We are importing the `BlocPipe` so that we can use it in our template.
:::

Lastly, our `counter_page_component.html` should look like:

<RemoteCode
	url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felangel/bloc/master/examples/angular_counter/lib/src/counter_page/counter_page_component.html"
	title="lib/src/counter_page/counter_page_component.html"
/>

:::note
We are using the `BlocPipe` so that we can display our `CounterBloc` state as it is updated.
:::

That's it! We've separated our presentation layer from our business logic layer. Our `CounterPageComponent` has no idea what happens when a user presses a button; it just adds an event to notify the `CounterBloc`. Furthermore, our `CounterBloc` has no idea what is happening with the state (counter value); it's simply converting the `CounterEvents` into integers.

We can run our app with `webdev serve` and can view it locally.
