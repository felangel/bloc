Linting is the process of statically analyzing code for potential bugs in
addition to programmatic and stylistic errors.

Bloc has a built-in linter, which can be used through your IDE or the
[`bloc command-line tools`](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc_tools) with the
`bloc lint` command.

With the help of the bloc linter, you can improve the quality of your codebase
and enforce consistency without executing a single line of code.

For example, perhaps you accidentally imported a Flutter dependency into your
cubit:

<AvoidFlutterImportsWarningSnippet />

If properly configured, the bloc linter will point to the import and produce the
following warning:

<AvoidFlutterImportsWarningOutputSnippet />

In the following sections, we'll cover how to install, configure, and customize
the bloc linter so that you can take advantage of static analysis in your
codebase.
