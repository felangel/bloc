You can customize the behavior of the bloc linter by changing the severity of
individual rules, individually enabling or disabling rules, and excluding files
from static analysis.

## Enabling and Disabling Rules

The bloc linter supports a growing list of lint rules. Note that lint rules
don't have to agree with each other. For example, some developers might prefer
to use blocs (`prefer_bloc`) while others might prefer to use cubits
(`prefer_cubit`).

:::note

Unlike static analysis, lint rules might contain false positives. Feel free to
report any false positives or other issues by
[filing an issue](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/issues/new/choose).

:::

### Enabling Recommended Rules

The bloc library provides a set of recommended lint rules as part of the
[`bloc_lint`](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc_lint) package.

To enable the recommended set of lints add the `bloc_lint` package as a dev
dependency:

<InstallBlocLintSnippet />

Then edit your `analysis_options.yaml` to include the rule set:

<BlocLintRecommendedAnalysisOptionsSnippet />

:::note

When a new version of `bloc_lint` is published, code that previously passed
static analysis might start failing. We recommend updating your code to work
with the new rules, or you can also optionally enable or disable individual
rules.

:::

### Enabling Individual Rules

To enable individual rules, add `bloc:` to the `analysis_options.yaml` file as a
top-level key and `rules:` as a second-level key. On subsequent lines, specify
the rules you want as a YAML list (prefixed with dashes).

For example:

<BlocLintEnablingRulesSnippet />

### Disabling Individual Rules

If you include an existing rule set such as the `recommended` set, you may want
to disable one or more included lint rules. Disabling rules is similar to
enabling them, but requires the use of a YAML map rather than a list.

For example, the following includes the recommended set of lint rules except for
`avoid_public_bloc_methods` and additionally enables the `prefer_bloc` rule:

<BlocLintDisablingRulesSnippet />

## Customizing Rule Severity

You can adjust the severity of any rule like so:

<BlocLintChangingSeveritySnippet />

Now the same lint rule will be reported with a severity of `info` instead of
`warning`:

<ImportFlutterInfoSnippet />

The output of the `bloc lint` command should look like:

<ImportFlutterInfoOutputSnippet />

The supported severity options are:

| Severity  | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `error`   | Indicates the pattern is not allowed.              |
| `warning` | Indicates the pattern is suspicious but allowed.   |
| `info`    | Provides information to users but is not a problem |
| `hint`    | Proposes a better way of achieving a result.       |

## Excluding Files

Sometimes it's okay for static analysis to fail. For example, you might want to
ignore warnings or errors reported in generated code that wasn't written by you
and your team. Just like with official Dart lint rules, you can use the
`exclude:` analyzer option to exclude files from static analysis.

You can either list individual files or use
[`glob`](https://pub.dev/packages/glob) patterns.

:::note

All usage of glob patterns should be relative to the directory containing the
corresponding `analysis_options.yaml` file.

:::

For example, we can exclude all generated Dart code via the following analysis
options:

<BlocLintExcludingFilesSnippet />
