# Recipes: Bloc Access

> In this recipe, we're going to take a look at how to use `BlocProvider` to make a bloc accessible throughout the widget tree. We're going to explore three scenarios: Local Access, Route Access, and Global Access.

## Local Access

> In this example, we're going to use `BlocProvider` to make a bloc available to a local sub-tree. In this context, local means within a context where there are no routes being pushed/popped.

### Bloc

For the sake of simplicity we're going to use a `Counter` as our example application.

Our `CounterBloc` implementation will look like:

```dart
enum CounterEvent { increment, decrement }

class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, int> {
  @override
  int get initialState => 0;

  @override
  Stream<int> mapEventToState(CounterEvent event) async* {
    switch (event) {
      case CounterEvent.decrement:
        yield currentState - 1;
        break;
      case CounterEvent.increment:
        yield currentState + 1;
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

### UI

We're going to have 3 parts to our UI:

- App: the root application widget
- CounterPage: the container widget which will manage the `CounterBloc` and exposes `FloatingActionButtons` to `increment` and `decrement` the counter.
- CounterText: a text widget which is responsible for displaying the current `count`.

#### App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

void main() => runApp(App());

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      home: BlocProvider(
        builder: (BuildContext context) => CounterBloc(),
        child: CounterPage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Our `App` widget is a `StatelessWidget` that uses a `MaterialApp` and sets our `CounterPage` as the home widget. The `App` widget is responsible for creating and closing the `CounterBloc` as well as making it available to the `CounterPage` using a `BlocProvider`.

?> **Note:** When we wrap a widget with `BlocProvider` we can then provide a bloc to all widgets within that subtree. In this case, we can access the `CounterBloc` from within the `CounterPage` widget and any children of the `CounterPage` widget using `BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context)`.

#### CounterPage

```dart
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final counterBloc = BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context);
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter')),
      body: Center(
        child: CounterText(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end,
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
        children: <Widget>[
          Padding(
            padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 5.0),
            child: FloatingActionButton(
              child: Icon(Icons.add),
              onPressed: () {
                counterBloc.add(CounterEvent.increment);
              },
            ),
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 5.0),
            child: FloatingActionButton(
              child: Icon(Icons.remove),
              onPressed: () {
                counterBloc.add(CounterEvent.decrement);
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The `CounterPage` widget is a `StatelessWidget` which is accesses the `CounterBloc` via the `BuildContext`.

#### CounterText

```dart
class CounterText extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocBuilder<CounterBloc, int>(
      builder: (context, count) {
        return Text('$count');
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Our `CounterText` widget is using a `BlocBuilder` to rebuild itself whenever the `CounterBloc` state changes. We use `BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context)` in order to access the provided `CounterBloc` and return a `Text` widget with the current count.

That wraps up the local bloc access portion of this recipe and the full source code can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/felangel/20b03abfef694c00038a4ffbcc788c35).

Next, we'll take a look at how to provide a bloc across multiple pages/routes.

## Route Access

> In this example, we're going to use `BlocProvider` to access a bloc across routes. When a new route is pushed, it will have a different `BuildContext` which no longer has a reference to the previously provided blocs. As a result, we have to wrap the new route in a separate `BlocProvider`.

### Bloc

Again, we're going to use the `CounterBloc` for simplicity.

```dart
enum CounterEvent { increment, decrement }

class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, int> {
  @override
  int get initialState => 0;

  @override
  Stream<int> mapEventToState(CounterEvent event) async* {
    switch (event) {
      case CounterEvent.decrement:
        yield currentState - 1;
        break;
      case CounterEvent.increment:
        yield currentState + 1;
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

### UI

Again, we're going to have three parts to our application's UI:

- App: the root application widget
- HomePage: the container widget which will manage the `CounterBloc` and exposes `FloatingActionButtons` to `increment` and `decrement` the counter.
- CounterPage: a widget which is responsible for displaying the current `count` as a separate route.

#### App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

void main() => runApp(App());

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      home: BlocProvider(
        builder: (BuildContext context) => CounterBloc(),
        child: HomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Again, our `App` widget is the same as before.

#### HomePage

```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final counterBloc = BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context);
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter')),
      body: Center(
        child: RaisedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).push(
              MaterialPageRoute<CounterPage>(
                builder: (context) {
                  return BlocProvider.value(
                    value: counterBloc,
                    child: CounterPage(),
                  );
                },
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Counter'),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end,
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
        children: <Widget>[
          Padding(
            padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 5.0),
            child: FloatingActionButton(
              heroTag: 0,
              child: Icon(Icons.add),
              onPressed: () {
                counterBloc.add(CounterEvent.increment);
              },
            ),
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 5.0),
            child: FloatingActionButton(
              heroTag: 1,
              child: Icon(Icons.remove),
              onPressed: () {
                counterBloc.add(CounterEvent.decrement);
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The `HomePage` is similar to the `CounterPage` in the above example; however, instead of rendering a `CounterText` widget, it renders a `RaisedButton` in the center which allows the user to navigate to a new screen which displays the current count.

When the user taps the `RaisedButton`, we push a new `MaterialPageRoute` and return the `CounterPage`; however, we are wrapping the `CounterPage` in a `BlocProvider` in order to make the current `CounterBloc` instance available on the next page.

!> It is critical that we are using `BlocProvider's` value constructor in this case because we are providing an existing instance of `CounterBloc`. The value constructor of `BlocProvider` should be used only in cases where we want to provide an existing bloc to a new subtree. In addition, using the value constructor will not close the bloc automatically which, in this case, is what we want (since we still need the `CounterBloc` to function in the ancestor widgets). Instead, we simply pass the existing `CounterBloc` to the new page as an existing value as opposed to in a builder. This ensures that the only top level `BlocProvider` handles closing the `CounterBloc` when it is no longer needed.

#### CounterPage

```dart
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Counter'),
      ),
      body: BlocBuilder<CounterBloc, int>(
        builder: (context, count) {
          return Center(
            child: Text('$count'),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

`CounterPage` is a super simple `StatelessWidget` which uses `BlocBuilder` to re-render a `Text` widget with the current count. Just like before, we are able to use `BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context)` in order to access the `CounterBloc`.

That's all there is to this example and the full source can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/felangel/92b256270c5567210285526a07b4cf21).

Last, we'll look at how to make a bloc globally available to the widget tree.

## Global Access

> In this last example, we're going to demonstrate how to make a bloc instance available to the entire widget tree. This is useful for specific cases like an `AuthenticationBloc` or `ThemeBloc` because that state applies to all parts of the application.

### Bloc

As usual, we're going to use the `CounterBloc` as our example for simplicity.

```dart
enum CounterEvent { increment, decrement }

class CounterBloc extends Bloc<CounterEvent, int> {
  @override
  int get initialState => 0;

  @override
  Stream<int> mapEventToState(CounterEvent event) async* {
    switch (event) {
      case CounterEvent.decrement:
        yield currentState - 1;
        break;
      case CounterEvent.increment:
        yield currentState + 1;
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

### UI

We're going to follow the same application structure as in the "Local Access" example. As a result, we're going to have three parts to our UI:

- App: the root application widget which manages the global instance of our `CounterBloc`.
- CounterPage: the container widget which exposes `FloatingActionButtons` to `increment` and `decrement` the counter.
- CounterText: a text widget which is responsible for displaying the current `count`.

#### App

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

void main() => runApp(App());

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      builder: (BuildContext context) => CounterBloc(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Flutter Demo',
        home: CounterPage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Much like in the local access example above, the `App` manages creating, closing, and providing the `CounterBloc` to the subtree using `BlocProvider`. The main difference is in this case, `MaterialApp` is a child of `BlocProvider`.

Wrapping the entire `MaterialApp` in a `BlocProvider` is the key to making our `CounterBloc` instance globally accessible. Now we can access our `CounterBloc` from anywhere in our application where we have a `BuildContext` using `BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context);`

?> **Note:** This approach still works if you're using a `CupertinoApp` or `WidgetsApp`.

#### CounterPage

```dart
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final CounterBloc counterBloc = BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context);
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter')),
      body: Center(
        child: CounterText(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end,
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
        children: <Widget>[
          Padding(
            padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 5.0),
            child: FloatingActionButton(
              child: Icon(Icons.add),
              onPressed: () {
                counterBloc.add(CounterEvent.increment);
              },
            ),
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 5.0),
            child: FloatingActionButton(
              child: Icon(Icons.remove),
              onPressed: () {
                counterBloc.add(CounterEvent.decrement);
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Our `CounterPage` is a `StatelessWidget` because it doesn't need to manage any of its own state. Just as we mentioned above, it uses `BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context)` to access the global instance of the `CounterBloc`.

#### CounterText

```dart
class CounterText extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocBuilder<CounterBloc, int>(
      builder: (context, count) {
        return Text('$count');
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Nothing new here; the `CounterText` widget is the same as in the first example. It's just a `StatelessWidget` which uses a `BlocBuilder` to re-render when the `CounterBloc` state changes and accesses the global `CounterBloc` instance using `BlocProvider.of<CounterBloc>(context)`.

That's all there is to it! The full source can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/felangel/be891e73a7c91cdec9e7d5f035a61d5d).
