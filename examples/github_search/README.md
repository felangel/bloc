Sample project which illustrates how to setup a Flutter and AngularDart project with code sharing.

## Quick Start

_Make sure you have the [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk) and [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install) installed before proceeding._

Open this project in your editor of choice (VSCode is recommended).

   cd ../
   ```

2. Install dependencies for `flutter_github_search`

   cd flutter_github_search

   # install dependencies
   flutter packages get

   # change directories back out to the root directory
   cd ../
   ```

3. Install dependencies for `angular`

   ```bash
   # change directories into angular
   cd angular

   # install dependencies
   pub get

   # change directories into flutter_github_search
   cd ../
   ```

### Run Flutter

# change directories into flutter_github_search
cd flutter_github_search

# run the flutter project
flutter run
